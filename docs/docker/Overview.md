# Docker Overview
- Docker is the only platform provider to address every application across the hybrid cloud
- Docker enables _true independence_ between applications and infrastructure and developers and IT ops

## What is a Container Platform?
- A _Container platform_ is a complete solution that allows organizations to solve multiple problems across a diverse set of requirements
- It is more than a piece of technology and orchestration
  - Delivers sustainable benefits throughout your organization by providing all the pieces an enterprise operation requires including:
    - Security
    - Governance
    - Automation
    - Support
    - Certification over the entire application lifecycle

## Use Cases
1. _Modernize Traditional Apps (MTA)_
    - The first step with Docker is to modernize the existing application portfolio
    - Packaging existing apps into containers:
      - Immediately improves security
      - Reduces costs
      - Gain cloud portability
    - This transformation applies to all _all_ legacy applications - **without changing a single line of code**
2. _Hybrid Cloud_
    - Cloud Migration, multi-cloud or hybrid cloud infrastructure require frictionless portability of applications
    - Docker packages applications and their dependencies together into an isolated container making them portable to any infrastructure
    - **Eliminates the "works on my machine" problem once and for all**
    - Docker certified infrastructure ensures the containerized applications work consistently
3. _Continuous Integration and Deployment (Devops)_
    - Integrate modern methodologies and automate development pipelines with the integration of Docker and DevOps
    - The isolated nature of containers makes it conducive to rapidly-changing environments by eliminating app conflicts and increasing developer productivity
    - Docker enables a true separation of concerns to accelerate the adoption of DevOps processes
4. _Microservices_
    - Docker containers are lightweight by design
      - This makes them _ideal for microservices application development_
    - Accelerate development, deployment and rollback of tens or hundred of containers composed as a single application
