# MandoDocs
A public repository for the notes I obsessively-create. I will update this Readme as I add more concepts I take notes on. 

## AWS
Everything AWS from high-level concepts to SDK usage.

## Spring Framework
I am documenting these concepts since the vast majority of the proprietary projects I work on utilize this framework. I feel it is absolutely essential that I understand the fundamentals of this framework in order to work with it effectively.

## Braintree Server SDK (Java)
One of the proprietary projects I am working on heavily-utilizes payment processing. As a result, I decided to integrate the Braintree Server SDK to facilitate the iOS and Android clients in our app. This is still a work in progress, but I will add concepts to this section as I work through the integration process.

## Apache Tomcat 9.0 Servlet Dispatcher
Tomcat functions as the Servlet Dispatcher in a number of my side projects. This section contains documents covering issues I encountered and overcame, as well as important implementation concepts.

## Mastodon4j
In one of my side projects, we needed an open source social media integration to allow user communication and networking. So, I opted for Mastodon. Mastodon is a well-known "twitter alternative" open-source social networking platform. The Java implementation, Mastodon4j, does not have much documentation and instead relies on the basic documentation for the base Mastodon API (which is not in Java). So, this section contains a more-convenient documentation source for Mastodon4j.
